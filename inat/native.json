Hoe or hand pull seedlings, mow or weed whack before flowering, or use an herbicide that is specific for that weed.  Herbicides are most effective on annual weeds when they are young, not long after germinating.   Seeds remaining in the soil in the seed bank will continue to germinate for several years, so long-term persistence is necessary. After the seed bank is exhausted, revegetate the area with desirable vegetation to prevent new infestations. An ongoing need for herbicides year after year may indicate a problem with the landscape that should be addressed before continuing to rely on chemical controls.","otherNames":"Indianmallow","cultivar":null,"derivation":"from aubutilum, Persian for \"prince of physicians\"","meaning":null,"ecology":"Colorado Noxious Weed List C; damaging weed to agricultural crops.","edibility":null,"endemic":null,"familyAckerfieldWithCommonName":"Malvaceae - Mallow","familyDetail":"non-woody plants and shrubs with stellate (star-shaped) hairs, palmately lobed (like a hand) leaves; numerous stamens (male or pollen-bearing organ) fused by their filaments (stalk supporting the anther or pollen-bearing part of the male organ); fruit often shaped like a cheese wheel; flowers usually radially symmetrical (can be divided in half any way to produce mirror images), 5 petals.","familyName":"Malvaceae - Mallow","familyId":null,"fiberDye":null,"flowerCluster":null,"flowerColor":"yellow","flowerDetail":null,"flowerShape":null,"flowerSize":"2 inches.","flowerStructure":"flowers bisexual (male and female parts in same flower).","flowerSymmetry":null,"frequency":"uncommon","fruitColor":null,"fruitType":"capsule (dry, multi-chambered fruit splitting at maturity).","fruitCone":null,"group":"angiosperm (plant with covered seed).","growthForm":"herbaceous","habitat":"valleys, waste places.","humanConnectionsVisibility":false,"landscapingVisibility":false,"leafArrangement":null,"leafType":"simple (not divided into similar parts)","leafLeafletShape":"cordate (heart-shaped).","legalStatus":null,"lifeCycle":"summer annual","lifeZone":"plains","light":null,"livestock":null,"maleFemale":null,"matureHeight":"to 3 feet.","matureSpread":null,"moisture":null,"originArea":null,"origin":"alien","otherUses":null,"parkId":null,"petalNumber":null,"scientificName":"Abutilon theophrasti  ","scientificNamePrefix":null,"scientificNameSuffix":null,"scientificMeaningAckerfield":null,"seasonOfBloom":"mid- to late summer (Jul. - Aug.).","soil":null,"speciesDetail":"tall, mostly unbranched annual; entire plant covered by dense and fine stellate (star-shaped) pubescence (hairs).","subGroup":"dicot (plants with two seed leaves and netted leaf veins).","subspeciesVarForma":null,"synonyms":null,"toxicity":null,"twigStemTexture":null,"use":null,"weedManagementVisibility":null,"plantImages":[],"rowVersion":"AAAAAAAAuFE="}

{"plantId":18,"availability":null,"barkTexture":null,"barkStemDetail":null,"commonName":"RUSSIAN KNAPWEED","control":"The key to controlling any creeping perennial is to exhaust the root nutrient stores, causing it to collapse. Plants often store at least a 3 - 4 year supply of food in their root systems. The use of a systemic herbicide, properly timed, is often a necessary strategy. Herbicides are most effective on perennial weeds in the early fall, when weeds are transporting energy to the roots before winter dormancy. Treatment just before and during flower bud initiation also is effective, as the herbicide will be carried with photosynthetic products to the roots. To ensure the presence of sufficient mature foliage, apply postemergent herbicides from 1 to 2 weeks before cultivation or mowing, or after weed regrowth is at least 8 inches tall. Herbicide control is least effective during times of rapid foliar growth, such as in the early spring, when energy that was stored in roots for the winter is transported above-ground to support new growth, or during a period of rapid regrowth after mowing. Hand pulling is seldom effective.  Mowing to prevent seed set and to stress the root system is another useful tool, where practical.

{"plantId":193,"availability":null,"barkTexture":null,"barkStemDetail":null,"commonName":"CANADA THISTLE","control":"The key to controlling any creeping perennial is to exhaust the root nutrient stores, causing it to collapse. Plants often store at least a 3 - 4 year supply of food in their root systems. The use of a systemic herbicide, properly timed, is often a necessary strategy. Herbicides are most effective on perennial weeds in the early fall, when weeds are transporting energy to the roots before winter dormancy. Treatment just before and during flower bud initiation also is effective, as the herbicide will be carried with photosynthetic products to the roots. To ensure the presence of sufficient mature foliage, apply postemergent herbicides from 1 to 2 weeks before cultivation or mowing, or after weed regrowth is at least 8 inches tall. Herbicide control is least effective during times of rapid foliar growth, such as in the early spring, when energy that was stored in roots for the winter is transported above-ground to support new growth, or during a period of rapid regrowth after mowing. Hand pulling is seldom effective.  Mowing to prevent seed set and to stress the root system is another useful tool, where practical. Systemic foliar applications can work poorly when plants are under water stress, or when they are dormant.  Many creeping perennial weeds can regrow from a section of root as small as 1/4 inch. Biological control: The primary biocontrol agent currently in use against Canada thistle is the stem-gall forming fly, Urophora cardui.  Urophora lays eggs in the stems of Canada thistle and large galls develop around the stem-dwelling larvae. This agent is not effective in killing the plant but may weaken the plant, making it more susceptible to other stresses. A stem mining weevil, Ceutorhynchus littura, has been released in Colorado but reliably collectable populations have yet to be established.  There is some evidence that these beetles may be effective in combination with the gall flies.","otherNames":null,"cultivar":null,"derivation":"Greek: cirsos = swollen vein, for which the thistle was considered a remedy; arvensis - of the fields","meaning":"non-native becoming common in Canada.","ecology":" introduced from Europe; thistle often pollinated by a variety of butterflies; host plant for Painted Lady butterflies.","edibility":null,"endemic":null,"familyAckerfieldWithCommonName":"Asteraceae - Sunflower","familyDetail":"alternate family name - Compositae; heads composed of many small ray (marginal) and/or disk (central) flowers on a flat or conical disk (receptacle); head (short, compact inflorescence or flower cluster) appears as single blossom and is surrounded by phyllaries (green bracts or reduced leaves); ray flowers (also called ligules) are strap shaped, bilaterally symmetrical (can be divided only one way to produce mirror images) and appear to be petals; disk flowers tubular, radially symmetrical (can be divided in half any way to produce mirror images) and in the center of head; some species have only ray flowers, some only disk flowers, others have both; sepal modified into bristle or scale (reduced leaf-like body that is not green) called pappus.","familyName":"Asteraceae - Sunflower","familyId":null,"fiberDye":null,"flowerCluster":"composite","flowerColor":"rose purple, lavender or white","flowerDetail":null,"flowerShape":null,"flowerSize":null,"flowerStructure":"flowers unisexual and dioecious","flowerSymmetry":null,"frequency":"common","fruitColor":null,"fruitType":"achene (small, dry, indehiscent - does not open upon maturity - fruit with a thin close-fitting wall surrounding a single seed).","fruitCone":null,"group":"angiosperm (plant with covered seed).","growthForm":"herbaceous","habitat":"fields, pastures, roadsides, disturbed areas.","humanConnectionsVisibility":false,"landscapingVisibility":false,"leafArrangement":null,"leafType":null,"leafLeafletShape":null,"legalStatus":"CO Noxious Weed List B - Weeds identified as having varying populations throughout the state.

Biocontrol: the musk thistle seed weevil, Rhinocyllus conicus, was released in Colorado over 30 years ago and can now be found throughout the state. In many areas it has significantly reduced the density of musk thistle. The CO Department of Agriculture has discontinued widespread distribution of this insect since it is found almost everywhere in the state, and it does feed on native thistles. Another weevil, Trichosirocalus horridus, feeds in the crowns of musk thistle, killing the apical meristem and reducing the flowering potential of the plant. This insect is currently established in many areas around the state and is still being distributed by the State Insectary.","otherNames":"nodding thistle, bristle thistle","cultivar":null,"derivation":"nutans - nodding","meaning":null,"ecology":"Colorado Noxious Weed List B; introduced from southern Europe and western Asia in the early part of this century; readily hybridizes with C. acanthoides.Thistles often pollinated by a variety of butterflies.","edibility":null,"endemic":null,"familyAckerfieldWithCommonName":"Asteraceae - Sunflower","familyDetail":"alternate family name - Compositae; heads composed of many small ray (marginal) and/or disk (central) flowers on a flat or conical disk (receptacle); head (short, compact inflorescence or flower cluster) appears as single blossom and is surrounded by phyllaries (green bracts or reduced leaves); ray flowers (also called ligules) are strap shaped, bilaterally symmetrical (can be divided only one way to produce mirror images) and appear to be petals; disk flowers tubular, radially symmetrical (can be divided in half any way to produce mirror images) and in the center of head; some species have only ray flowers, some only disk flowers, others have both; sepal modified into bristle or scale (reduced leaf-like body that is not green) called pappus.","familyName":"Asteraceae - Sunflower","familyId":null,"fiberDye":null,"flowerCluster":"composite","flowerColor":"reddish-purple","flowerDetail":null,"flowerShape":null,"flowerSize":null,"flowerStructure":null,"flowerSymmetry":null,"frequency":"common","fruitColor":null,"fruitType":"achene (small, dry, indehiscent - does not open upon maturity - fruit with a thin close-fitting wall surrounding a single seed).","fruitCone":null,"group":"angiosperm (plant with covered seed).","growthForm":"herbaceous","habitat":"neglected fields, overgrazed meadows and roadsides.","humanConnectionsVisibility":false,"landscapingVisibility":false,"leafArrangement":null,"leafType":"simple (not divided into similar parts), pinnatifid (lobed into segments without stalks) to bipinnatifid (lobed twice into segments without stalks)","leafLeafletShape":null,"legalStatus":null,"lifeCycle":"biennial","lifeZone":"plains/foothills","light":null,"livestock":null,"maleFemale":null,"matureHeight":"to 6 feet.","matureSpread":null,"moisture":null,"originArea":null,"origin":"alien","otherUses":null,"parkId":null,"petalNumber":null,"scientificName":"Carduus nutans  ","scientificNamePrefix":null,"scientificNameSuffix":null,"scientificMeaningAckerfield":null,"seasonOfBloom":"summer (Jun. - Aug.)","soil":null,"speciesDetail":"heads with disk flowers only; pappus (extension of the ovary in sunflower family) barbellate (with short barbs); outer phyllaries (bracts - small leaf-like structures - that subtend a composite flower head) spreading-reflexed (bent backwards).","subGroup":"dicot (plants with two seed leaves and netted leaf veins).","subspeciesVarForma":null,"synonyms":null,"toxicity":null,"twigStemTexture":null,"use":null,"weedManagementVisibility":null,"plantImages":[{"$id":"3","plantImageId":0,"plantId":null,"scientificName":null,"imageName":"carduus_nutans_1_main_400x278","copyRight":"Courtesy of Lookout Mountain Nature Center, lmnc.jeffco.us","source":null,"acknowledgement":"Courtesy of Lookout Mountain Nature Center, lmnc.jeffco.us","imageUrl":"https://extension.colostate.edu/county/jeffco/natural/plant_images/carduus_nutans_1_main_400x278.jpg","plantDetail":null,"rowVersion":null},{"$id":"4","plantImageId":0,"plantId":null,"scientificName":null,"imageName":"carduus_nutans_2_400x304","copyRight":"Courtesy of Lookout Mountain Nature Center, lmnc.jeffco.us","source":null,"acknowledgement":"Courtesy of Lookout Mountain Nature Center, lmnc.jeffco.us","imageUrl":"https://extension.colostate.edu/county/jeffco/natural/plant_images/carduus_nutans_2_400x304.jpg","plantDetail":null,"rowVersion":null}],"rowVersion":"AAAAAAAAtJI="}

{"plantId":270,"availability":null,"barkTexture":null,"barkStemDetail":null,"commonName":"BULL THISTLE","control":"Because biennials only spread from seed, the key to controlling biennial weeds is to keep them from going to seed.  Hoe or hand pull seedlings, mow or weed whack before flowering, or use an herbicide that is specific for that weed.  Seeds remaining in the soil in the seed bank will continue to germinate for several years, so long-term persistence is necessary. After the seed bank is exhausted, revegetate the area with desirable vegetation to prevent new infestations. An ongoing need for herbicides year after year may indicate a problem with the landscape that should be addressed before continuing to rely on chemical controls. Biological control: Urophora stylata, a fly predator, is used to help control this thistle. The female fly lays eggs in the seed head of the thistle. The maggot then consumes the seed in the flower. This species has overwintered in Colorado but the limited numbers will not allow for general redistribution.","otherNames":"spear thistle, plume thistle, bur thistle","cultivar":null,"derivation":"Greek: cirsos = swollen vein, for which the thistle was considered a remedy; vulgare - common","meaning":null,"ecology":"Colorado Noxious Weed List B; Eurasian weed.

{"plantId":282,"availability":null,"barkTexture":null,"barkStemDetail":null,"commonName":"FIELD BINDWEED","control":"Difficult to eradicate due to the long taproot which may penetrate to 10 ft. and the brittle rhizomes (prostrate undergound stems) which break off easily, causing the plant to proliferate through further branching at the rhizome nodes; seeds remain viable for up to 50 years.  The key to controlling any creeping perennial is to exhaust the root nutrient stores, causing it to collapse. Plants often store at least a 3 - 4 year supply of food in their root systems. The use of a systemic herbicide, properly timed, is often a necessary strategy. Herbicides are most effective on perennial weeds in the early fall, when weeds are transporting energy to the roots before winter dormancy. Treatment just before and during flower bud initiation also is effective, as the herbicide will be carried with photosynthetic products to the roots.  To ensure the presence of sufficient mature foliage, apply postemergent herbicides from 1 to 2 weeks before cultivation or mowing, or after weed regrowth is at least 8 inches tall. Herbicide control is least effective during times of rapid foliar growth, such as in the early spring, when energy that was stored in roots for the winter is transported above-ground to support new growth, or during a period of rapid regrowth after mowing.  Hand pulling is seldom effective.  Mowing to prevent seed set and to stress the root system is another useful tool, where practical. Systemic foliar applications can work poorly when plants are under water stress, or when they are dormant.  Many creeping perennial weeds can regrow from a section of root as small as 1/4 inch.  Biocontrol: Two species of natural enemies are presently being released in Colorado for the suppression of field bindweed.  The first, a small eriophyid mite, Aceria malherbae, is a microscopic wormlike mite that causes gall formation along the midribs of the leaves, petioles and stem tips, stunting the plant and reducing seed production. They only survive in unirrigated areas.  They are established in Colorado and are available upon request.The bindweed moth, Tyta luctuosa, is also being reared at the Insectary for release to the field.  Larvae of this noctuid moth defoliate bindweed plants by consuming both leaves and flower buds. The moth has now been found to overwinter in the Grand Valley, the first place in the United States where establishment has been documented.","otherNames":"field bindweed, creeping jenny, morning glory","cultivar":null,"derivation":"arvensis - of cultivated fields","meaning":"bindweed - twining habit","ecology":"Colorado Noxious Weed List C; introduced from Europe.

Hoe or hand pull seedlings, mow or weed whack before flowering, or use an herbicide that is specific for that weed.

Seeds remaining in the soil in the seed bank will continue to germinate for several years, so long-term persistence is necessary. After the seed bank is exhausted, revegetate the area with desirable vegetation to prevent new infestations.

{"plantId":393,"availability":null,"barkTexture":null,"barkStemDetail":null,"commonName":"QUACKGRASS","control":"It invades mixed-grass prairies, roadsides, ditches, crop fields, gardens, yards, and just about any disturbed, moist area. The key to controlling any creeping perennial is to exhaust the root nutrient stores, causing it to collapse. Plants often store at least a 3 - 4 year supply of food in their root systems. The use of a systemic herbicide, properly timed, is often a necessary strategy. Herbicides are most effective on perennial weeds in the early fall, when weeds are transporting energy to the roots before winter dormancy. Treatment just before and during flower bud initiation also is effective, as the herbicide will be carried with photosynthetic products to the roots.  To ensure the presence of sufficient mature foliage, apply postemergent herbicides from 1 to 2 weeks before cultivation or mowing, or after weed regrowth is at least 8 inches tall. Herbicide control is least effective during times of rapid foliar growth, such as in the early spring, when energy that was stored in roots for the winter is transported above-ground to support new growth, or during a period of rapid regrowth after mowing.  Hand pulling is seldom effective.  Mowing to prevent seed set and to stress the root system is another useful tool, where practical. Systemic foliar applications can work poorly when plants are under water stress, or when they are dormant.  Many creeping perennial weeds can regrow from a section of root as small as 1/4 inch.","otherNames":null,"cultivar":null,"derivation":"repens - creeping","meaning":null,"ecology":"Colorado Noxious Weed List B.

Seeds remaining in the soil in the seed bank will continue to germinate for several years, so long-term persistence is necessary. After the seed bank is exhausted, revegetate the area with desirable vegetation to prevent new infestations.

{"plantId":514,"availability":null,"barkTexture":null,"barkStemDetail":null,"commonName":"COMMON ST. JOHNSWORT","control":"The key to controlling any creeping perennial is to exhaust the root nutrient stores, causing it to collapse. Plants often store at least a 3 - 4 year supply of food in their root systems. The use of a systemic herbicide, properly timed, is often a necessary strategy. Herbicides are most effective on perennial weeds in the early fall, when weeds are transporting energy to the roots before winter dormancy. Treatment just before and during flower bud initiation also is effective, as the herbicide will be carried with photosynthetic products to the roots. To ensure the presence of sufficient mature foliage, apply postemergent herbicides from 1 to 2 weeks before cultivation or mowing, or after weed regrowth is at least 8 inches tall. Herbicide control is least effective during times of rapid foliar growth, such as in the early spring, when energy that was stored in roots for the winter is transported above-ground to support new growth, or during a period of rapid regrowth after mowing. Hand pulling is seldom effective.  Mowing to prevent seed set and to stress the root system is another useful tool, where practical. Systemic foliar applications can work poorly when plants are under water stress, or when they are dormant.","otherNames":"klamath weed","cultivar":null,"derivation":"perforatum - with holes, perforated","meaning":null,"ecology":"Colorado Noxious Weed List C; European noxious weed which is a major pest in the west due to its degradation of rangelands.","edibility":"poisonous to sheep, causing starvation following blindness and/or refusal to eat.","endemic":null,"familyAckerfieldWithCommonName":"Clusiaceae - St. John's-wort","familyDetail":"trees, shrubs or herbs; leaves simple, entire (without teeth or lobes), opposite and often gland-dotted; sepals 2 - 10, (5 in CO); petals 4 - 12 (5 yellow in CO).","familyName":"Clusiaceae - St. John's-wort","familyId":null,"fiberDye":null,"flowerCluster":"cyme (branched flower cluster with central flower first blooming)","flowerColor":"yellow","flowerDetail":null,"flowerShape":null,"flowerSize":null,"flowerStructure":null,"flowerSymmetry":"radial","frequency":"common","fruitColor":null,"fruitType":null,"fruitCone":null,"group":"angiosperm (plant with covered seed).","growthForm":"herbaceous","habitat":"pastures, fields, roadsides.","humanConnectionsVisibility":null,"landscapingVisibility":false,"leafArrangement":null,"leafType":"simple (not divided into similar parts), opposite (originating in pairs at the node - joint where the leaf joins the stem)","leafLeafletShape":null,"legalStatus":null,"lifeCycle":"creeping perennial","lifeZone":"plains to montane","light":null,"livestock":null,"maleFemale":null,"matureHeight":"to 3 feet.","matureSpread":null,"moisture":null,"originArea":null,"origin":"alien","otherUses":null,"parkId":null,"petalNumber":"5","scientificName":"Hypericum perforatum  ","scientificNamePrefix":null,"scientificNameSuffix":null,"scientificMeaningAckerfield":null,"seasonOfBloom":"early summer to early fall (Jun. - Sep.).","soil":null,"speciesDetail":"opposite leaves with translucent dots; leaves narrowly oblong; plants much branched with flowers numerous in a broad flat-topped cluster.","subGroup":"dicot (plants with two seed leaves and netted leaf veins).","subspeciesVarForma":null,"synonyms":null,"toxicity":"St. Johnswort contains hypericin, a phototoxin that travels to the skin after ingestion.

Plants often store at least a 3 - 4 year supply of food in their root systems. The use of a systemic herbicide, properly timed, is often a necessary strategy. Herbicides are most effective on perennial weeds in the early fall, when weeds are transporting energy to the roots before winter dormancy. Treatment just before and during flower bud initiation also is effective, as the herbicide will be carried with photosynthetic products to the roots. To ensure the presence of sufficient mature foliage, apply postemergent herbicides from 1 to 2 weeks before cultivation or mowing, or after weed regrowth is at least 8 inches tall. Herbicide control is least effective during times of rapid foliar growth, such as in the early spring, when energy that was stored in roots for the winter is transported above-ground to support new growth, or during a period of rapid regrowth after mowing. Hand pulling is seldom effective.  Mowing to prevent seed set and to stress the root system is another useful tool, where practical.

Plants often store at least a 3 - 4 year supply of food in their root systems. The use of a systemic herbicide, properly timed, is often a necessary strategy. Herbicides are most effective on perennial weeds in the early fall, when weeds are transporting energy to the roots before winter dormancy. Treatment just before and during flower bud initiation also is effective, as the herbicide will be carried with photosynthetic products to the roots. To ensure the presence of sufficient mature foliage, apply postemergent herbicides from 1 to 2 weeks before cultivation or mowing, or after weed regrowth is at least 8 inches tall. Herbicide control is least effective during times of rapid foliar growth, such as in the early spring, when energy that was stored in roots for the winter is transported above-ground to support new growth, or during a period of rapid regrowth after mowing.  Hand pulling is seldom effective.  Mowing to prevent seed set and to stress the root system is another useful tool, where practical. Systemic foliar applications can work poorly when plants are under water stress, or when they are dormant.  Many creeping perennial weeds can regrow from a section of root as small as 1/4 inch.

{"plantId":794,"availability":null,"barkTexture":null,"barkStemDetail":null,"commonName":"SULFUR CINQUEFOIL","control":"The key to controlling any creeping perennial is to exhaust the root nutrient stores, causing it to collapse. Plants often store at least a 3 - 4 year supply of food in their root systems. The use of a systemic herbicide, properly timed, is often a necessary strategy. Herbicides are most effective on perennial weeds in the early fall, when weeds are transporting energy to the roots before winter dormancy. Treatment just before and during flower bud initiation also is effective, as the herbicide will be carried with photosynthetic products to the roots. To ensure the presence of sufficient mature foliage, apply postemergent herbicides from 1 to 2 weeks before cultivation or mowing, or after weed regrowth is at least 8 inches tall. Herbicide control is least effective during times of rapid foliar growth, such as in the early spring, when energy that was stored in roots for the winter is transported above-ground to support new growth, or during a period of rapid regrowth after mowing. Hand pulling is seldom effective.  Mowing to prevent seed set and to stress the root system is another useful tool, where practical. Systemic foliar applications can work poorly when plants are under water stress, or when they are dormant.","otherNames":"upright potentilla","cultivar":null,"derivation":"recta - upright","meaning":null,"ecology":"Colorado Noxious Weed List B; originally known from a few collections near Boulder; now an extremely abundant weed at Roxborough State Park and spreading in the Boulder area; on the State noxious weed list as a potential problem species; species in this genus are host plants for the Dorcas Copper, a 1 inch copper-brown butterfly distributed over much of the northern United States and found in moist meadows, forest clearings and bogs.","edibility":null,"endemic":null,"familyAckerfieldWithCommonName":"Rosaceae - Rose","familyDetail":"trees, shrubs, or non-woody plants; radially symmetrical flowers (can be divided in half any way to produce mirror images), 5 petals, hypanthium (fused bases of floral structures forming cup or tube); alternate leaves (one leaf per node - joint of the stem where the leaves join stem), simple (not divided into many similar parts) or compound (divided into 2 or more similar parts) with paired stipules (leaf-like appendages where leaf stalk joins stem); many commercial fruits in this family (strawberry, peach, apple, raspberry, cherry, plum).","familyName":"Rosaceae - Rose","familyId":null,"fiberDye":null,"flowerCluster":null,"flowerColor":"pale yellow","flowerDetail":null,"flowerShape":null,"flowerSize":"0.5 to 1 inch.","flowerStructure":null,"flowerSymmetry":"radial","frequency":"common","fruitColor":null,"fruitType":"achene (small, dry, indehiscent - does not open upon maturity - fruit with a thin close-fitting wall surrounding a single seed).","fruitCone":null,"group":"angiosperm (plant with covered seed).","growthForm":"herbaceous","habitat":"trailsides, roadsides, disturbed areas.","humanConnectionsVisibility":false,"landscapingVisibility":false,"leafArrangement":null,"leafType":"compound (divided into 2 or more similar parts), palmate (divided into leaflets like a hand)","leafLeafletShape":null,"legalStatus":null,"lifeCycle":"creeping perennial","lifeZone":"plains","light":null,"livestock":null,"maleFemale":null,"matureHeight":"1 to 2 feet.","matureSpread":"1 to 2 feet.","moisture":null,"originArea":null,"origin":"alien","otherUses":null,"parkId":null,"petalNumber":null,"scientificName":"Potentilla recta  ","scientificNamePrefix":null,"scientificNameSuffix":null,"scientificMeaningAckerfield":null,"seasonOfBloom":"summer (Jun. - Aug.).","soil":null,"speciesDetail":"leaves digitately compound (divided like a hand), coarsely toothed; annual or short-lived perennial; pubescence (hairs) of short glandular hairs and long, pilose (sparse, long, soft) hairs.","subGroup":"dicot (plants with two seed leaves and netted leaf veins).","subspeciesVarForma":null,"synonyms":null,"toxicity":null,"twigStemTexture":null,"use":null,"weedManagementVisibility":null,"plantImages":[{"$id":"3","plantImageId":0,"plantId":null,"scientificName":null,"imageName":"potentilla_recta_400x267","copyRight":"Copyright:Theodore Webster, USDA Agriculture Research Service, www.forestryimages.org","source":"Bugwood Network www.IPMimages.org","acknowledgement":"Â© Theodore Webster, USDA Agriculture Research Service, www.forestryimages.org","imageUrl":"https://extension.colostate.edu/county/jeffco/natural/plant_images/potentilla_recta_400x267.jpg","plantDetail":null,"rowVersion":null}],"rowVersion":"AAAAAAAAupc="}

{"plantId":877,"availability":null,"barkTexture":null,"barkStemDetail":null,"commonName":"BOUNCINGBET","control":"The key to controlling any creeping perennial is to exhaust the root nutrient stores, causing it to collapse. Plants often store at least a 3 - 4 year supply of food in their root systems. The use of a systemic herbicide, properly timed, is often a necessary strategy. Herbicides are most effective on perennial weeds in the early fall, when weeds are transporting energy to the roots before winter dormancy. Treatment just before and during flower bud initiation also is effective, as the herbicide will be carried with photosynthetic products to the roots. To ensure the presence of sufficient mature foliage, apply postemergent herbicides from 1 to 2 weeks before cultivation or mowing, or after weed regrowth is at least 8 inches tall. Herbicide control is least effective during times of rapid foliar growth, such as in the early spring, when energy that was stored in roots for the winter is transported above-ground to support new growth, or during a period of rapid regrowth after mowing. Hand pulling is seldom effective.  Mowing to prevent seed set and to stress the root system is another useful tool, where practical. Systemic foliar applications can work poorly when plants are under water stress, or when they are dormant.","otherNames":"soapwort, soapweed","cultivar":null,"derivation":"officinalis - medicinal","meaning":null,"ecology":"Colorado Noxious Weed List B; introduced from Europe as a garden plant, probably during the gold rush in the mid-1800's; most species in this family are protandrous, in which anthers mature first in the flower.","edibility":"unpalatable and poisonous to livestock.","endemic":null,"familyAckerfieldWithCommonName":"Caryophyllaceae - Pink","familyDetail":"non-woody; leaves opposite (originating in pairs at the nodes (joint of the stem where the leaves join stem), whorled or rarely alternate, simple (not divided into many similar parts) and entire (without marginal teeth), often with swollen nodes; flowers radially symmetrical (can be divided in half any way to produce mirror images), usually perfect (with female and male parts), often in terminal or axillary cymes (opposite-branched flower cluster); petals distinct, 4 or 5, or rarely none; ovary superior (petals attached at base).","familyName":"Caryophyllaceae - Pink","familyId":null,"fiberDye":null,"flowerCluster":null,"flowerColor":"pink or white","flowerDetail":null,"flowerShape":null,"flowerSize":null,"flowerStructure":null,"flowerSymmetry":"radial","frequency":"common","fruitColor":null,"fruitType":null,"fruitCone":null,"group":"angiosperm (plant with covered seed).","growthForm":"herbaceous","habitat":"roadsides","humanConnectionsVisibility":null,"landscapingVisibility":false,"leafArrangement":null,"leafType":"simple (not divided into similar parts), opposite (originating in pairs at the node - joint where the leaf joins the stem)","leafLeafletShape":null,"legalStatus":null,"lifeCycle":"creeping perennial","lifeZone":"foothills","light":null,"livestock":null,"maleFemale":null,"matureHeight":"to 3 feet.","matureSpread":null,"moisture":null,"originArea":null,"origin":"alien","otherUses":"leaves make a soapy lather when crushed and agitated in water.","parkId":null,"petalNumber":null,"scientificName":"Saponaria officinalis  ","scientificNamePrefix":null,"scientificNameSuffix":null,"scientificMeaningAckerfield":null,"seasonOfBloom":"summer (Jun. - Aug.).","soil":null,"speciesDetail":"calyx (ring of sepals) terete (round in cross-section) and without bracts (small leaf-like structures) at the base.","subGroup":"dicot (plants with two seed leaves and netted leaf veins).","subspeciesVarForma":null,"synonyms":null,"toxicity":"If eaten in sufficient quantity, the saponins may cause acute hepatopathy and death for cattle, horses and sheep; usually avoided due to unpalatability.","twigStemTexture":null,"use":null,"weedManagementVisibility":null,"plantImages":[{"$id":"3","plantImageId":0,"plantId":null,"scientificName":null,"imageName":"saponaria_officinalis_299x400","copyRight":"Copyright:John M.

{"plantId":930,"availability":null,"barkTexture":null,"barkStemDetail":null,"commonName":"JOHNSONGRASS","control":"The key to controlling any creeping perennial is to exhaust the root nutrient stores, causing it to collapse. Plants often store at least a 3 - 4 year supply of food in their root systems. The use of a systemic herbicide, properly timed, is often a necessary strategy. Herbicides are most effective on perennial weeds in the early fall, when weeds are transporting energy to the roots before winter dormancy. Treatment just before and during flower bud initiation also is effective, as the herbicide will be carried with photosynthetic products to the roots. To ensure the presence of sufficient mature foliage, apply postemergent herbicides from 1 to 2 weeks before cultivation or mowing, or after weed regrowth is at least 8 inches tall. Herbicide control is least effective during times of rapid foliar growth, such as in the early spring, when energy that was stored in roots for the winter is transported above-ground to support new growth, or during a period of rapid regrowth after mowing.

{"plantId":970,"availability":null,"barkTexture":null,"barkStemDetail":null,"commonName":"LEAFY SPURGE","control":"A combination of methods is essential to control leafy spurge.  Persistence is imperative to gain control.  The key to controlling any creeping perennial is to exhaust the root nutrient stores, causing it to collapse. Plants often store at least a 3 - 4 year supply of food in their root systems. The use of a systemic herbicide, properly timed, is often a necessary strategy. Herbicides are most effective on perennial weeds in the early fall, when weeds are transporting energy to the roots before winter dormancy. Treatment just before and during flower bud initiation also is effective, as the herbicide will be carried with photosynthetic products to the roots.  To ensure the presence of sufficient mature foliage, apply postemergent herbicides from 1 to 2 weeks before cultivation or mowing, or after weed regrowth is at least 8 inches tall. Herbicide control is least effective during times of rapid foliar growth, such as in the early spring, when energy that was stored in roots for the winter is transported above-ground to support new growth, or during a period of rapid regrowth after mowing.  Hand pulling is seldom effective.  Mowing to prevent seed set and to stress the root system is another useful tool, where practical. Systemic foliar applications can work poorly when plants are under water stress, or when they are dormant.  Many creeping perennial weeds can regrow from a section of root as small as 1/4 inch.  Sheep or goats can be used to help control leafy spurge. Rotate pastures to prevent seed production and allow desirable forage plants to regain vigor. Recent research completed by Colorado State University showed that six to eight sheep per acre grazing for 10 days in July over a period of five years decreased leafy spurge density about 90 percent. When flea beetles grazed simultaneously in July with eight sheep per acre for 10 days over five years, leafy spurge density was decreased to zero. Sheep or goats followed by fall herbicide treatment may be an effective, integrated means to use infested ground and control the weed.The Colorado Department of Agriculture insectary has four flea beetles (Apthona nigriscutis, black-dot flea beetle; A. cyparissiae, brown-dot spurge flea beetle; A. czwalinae, black spurge flea beetle; and A. flava, copper spurge flea beetle) available for release.

Because annuals only spread from seed, the key to controlling annual weeds is to keep them from going to seed.  Hoe or hand pull seedlings, mow or weed-whack before flowering, or use an herbicide that is specific for that weed.  Herbicides are most effective on annual weeds when they are young, not long after germinating.   Seeds remaining in the soil in the seed bank will continue to germinate for several years, so long-term persistence is necessary.  After the seed bank is exhausted, revegetate the area with desirable vegetation to prevent new infestations. An ongoing need for herbicides year after year may indicate a problem with the landscape that should be addressed before continuing to rely on chemical controls. The most successful biological control agents are Microlarinus lareynii, a seed feeding weevil, and Microlarinus lypriformis, a stem boring weevil.

{"plantId":1128,"availability":null,"barkTexture":null,"barkStemDetail":null,"commonName":"SWAMP SOWTHISTLE","control":" The key to controlling any creeping perennial is to exhaust the root nutrient stores, causing it to collapse. Plants often store at least a 3 - 4 year supply of food in their root systems. The use of a systemic herbicide, properly timed, is often a necessary strategy. Herbicides are most effective on perennial weeds in the early fall, when weeds are transporting energy to the roots before winter dormancy. Treatment just before and during flower bud initiation also is effective, as the herbicide will be carried with photosynthetic products to the roots. To ensure the presence of sufficient mature foliage, apply postemergent herbicides from 1 to 2 weeks before cultivation or mowing, or after weed regrowth is at least 8 inches tall. Herbicide control is least effective during times of rapid foliar growth, such as in the early spring, when energy that was stored in roots for the winter is transported above-ground to support new growth, or during a period of rapid regrowth after mowing. Hand pulling is seldom effective.  Mowing to prevent seed set and to stress the root system is another useful tool, where practical. Systemic foliar applications can work poorly when plants are under water stress, or when they are dormant.","otherNames":"PERENNIAL SOWTHISTLE","cultivar":null,"derivation":"uliginosus - of swamps, marshes","meaning":null,"ecology":null,"edibility":null,"endemic":null,"familyAckerfieldWithCommonName":"Asteraceae - Sunflower","familyDetail":"alternate family name - Compositae; heads composed of many small ray (marginal) and/or disk (central) flowers on a flat or conical disk (receptacle); head (short, compact inflorescence or flower cluster) appears as single blossom and is surrounded by phyllaries (green bracts or reduced leaves); ray flowers (also called ligules) are strap shaped, bilaterally symmetrical (can be divided only one way to produce mirror images) and appear to be petals; disk flowers tubular, radially symmetrical (can be divided in half any way to produce mirror images) and in the center of head; some species have only ray flowers, some only disk flowers, others have both; sepal modified into bristle or scale (reduced leaf-like body that is not green) called pappus.","familyName":"Asteraceae - Sunflower","familyId":null,"fiberDye":null,"flowerCluster":"composite, ray flowers only in a head.","flowerColor":"yellow","flowerDetail":null,"flowerShape":null,"flowerSize":null,"flowerStructure":null,"flowerSymmetry":null,"frequency":null,"fruitColor":null,"fruitType":null,"fruitCone":null,"group":"angiosperm (plant with covered seed).","growthForm":"herbaceous","habitat":"wet meadows and cultivated ground","humanConnectionsVisibility":false,"landscapingVisibility":false,"leafArrangement":null,"leafType":null,"leafLeafletShape":null,"legalStatus":"Not on the CO noxious weed list but considered a subspecies of S. arvensis (which is on the list) by the Flora of North America.","lifeCycle":"perennial","lifeZone":null,"light":null,"livestock":null,"maleFemale":null,"matureHeight":null,"matureSpread":null,"moisture":null,"originArea":null,"origin":"alien","otherUses":null,"parkId":null,"petalNumber":null,"scientificName":"Sonchus uliginosus  ","scientificNamePrefix":null,"scientificNameSuffix":null,"scientificMeaningAckerfield":null,"seasonOfBloom":null,"soil":null,"speciesDetail":"involucre (fused bracts at base of flower cluster) glabrous (hairless) and usually with large glandular spots.","subGroup":"dicot (plants with two seed leaves and netted leaf veins).","subspeciesVarForma":null,"synonyms":null,"toxicity":null,"twigStemTexture":null,"use":null,"weedManagementVisibility":null,"plantImages":[],"rowVersion":"AAAAAAAAuCE="}

{"plantId":1135,"availability":null,"barkTexture":null,"barkStemDetail":null,"commonName":"PERENNIAL SOWTHISTLE","control":"The key to controlling any creeping perennial is to exhaust the root nutrient stores, causing it to collapse. Plants often store at least a 3 - 4 year supply of food in their root systems. The use of a systemic herbicide, properly timed, is often a necessary strategy. Herbicides are most effective on perennial weeds in the early fall, when weeds are transporting energy to the roots before winter dormancy. Treatment just before and during flower bud initiation also is effective, as the herbicide will be carried with photosynthetic products to the roots. To ensure the presence of sufficient mature foliage, apply postemergent herbicides from 1 to 2 weeks before cultivation or mowing, or after weed regrowth is at least 8 inches tall. Herbicide control is least effective during times of rapid foliar growth, such as in the early spring, when energy that was stored in roots for the winter is transported above-ground to support new growth, or during a period of rapid regrowth after mowing. Hand pulling is seldom effective.  Mowing to prevent seed set and to stress the root system is another useful tool, where practical. Systemic foliar applications can work poorly when plants are under water stress, or when they are dormant.","otherNames":null,"cultivar":null,"derivation":"arvensis - of the field","meaning":null,"ecology":null,"edibility":null,"endemic":null,"familyAckerfieldWithCommonName":"Asteraceae - Sunflower","familyDetail":"alternate family name - Compositae; heads composed of many small ray (marginal) and/or disk (central) flowers on a flat or conical disk (receptacle); head (short, compact inflorescence or flower cluster) appears as single blossom and is surrounded by phyllaries (green bracts or reduced leaves); ray flowers (also called ligules) are strap shaped, bilaterally symmetrical (can be divided only one way to produce mirror images) and appear to be petals; disk flowers tubular, radially symmetrical (can be divided in half any way to produce mirror images) and in the center of head; some species have only ray flowers, some only disk flowers, others have both; sepal modified into bristle or scale (reduced leaf-like body that is not green) called pappus.","familyName":"Asteraceae - Sunflower","familyId":null,"fiberDye":null,"flowerCluster":"composite, ray flowers only in a head.","flowerColor":null,"flowerDetail":null,"flowerShape":null,"flowerSize":null,"flowerStructure":null,"flowerSymmetry":null,"frequency":null,"fruitColor":null,"fruitType":null,"fruitCone":null,"group":"angiosperm (plant with covered seed).","growthForm":"herbaceous","habitat":"wet meadows and cultivated ground","humanConnectionsVisibility":false,"landscapingVisibility":false,"leafArrangement":null,"leafType":null,"leafLeafletShape":null,"legalStatus":"CO Noxious Weed List C - Control recommended.

{"plantId":1174,"availability":null,"barkTexture":null,"barkStemDetail":null,"commonName":"ORANGE HAWKWEED","control":"The key to controlling any creeping perennial is to exhaust the root nutrient stores, causing it to collapse. Plants often store at least a 3 - 4 year supply of food in their root systems. The use of a systemic herbicide, properly timed, is often a necessary strategy. Herbicides are most effective on perennial weeds in the early fall, when weeds are transporting energy to the roots before winter dormancy. Treatment just before and during flower bud initiation also is effective, as the herbicide will be carried with photosynthetic products to the roots. To ensure the presence of sufficient mature foliage, apply postemergent herbicides from 1 to 2 weeks before cultivation or mowing, or after weed regrowth is at least 8 inches tall. Herbicide control is least effective during times of rapid foliar growth, such as in the early spring, when energy that was stored in roots for the winter is transported above-ground to support new growth, or during a period of rapid regrowth after mowing. Hand pulling is seldom effective.  Mowing to prevent seed set and to stress the root system is another useful tool, where practical. Systemic foliar applications can work poorly when plants are under water stress, or when they are dormant.","otherNames":null,"cultivar":null,"derivation":"aurantiaca - orange-colored","meaning":null,"ecology":"Recent invader originating in Europe that reproduces by rhizomes, runners, root buds and seed.
